<p>Itâ€™s a well known fact that olympiads get harder over time. The rate of difficulty inflation varies, but it always happens.</p>

<p>For example, see Problem 1 from the first International Math Olympiad in 1959.</p>

<p>Prove that this fraction is irreducible for every natural number \(n\): \[ \frac{21n+4}{14n+3} \]</p>

<p>Despite this being a proof problem, itâ€™s much easier than any</p>
