I"¿	<p>‚ÄúDivergent series are the invention of the devil, and it is a shame to base on them any demonstration whatsoever‚Äù -Niels Henrik Abel</p>

<p>When discussing infinite series, we usually tend to classify them as convergent or divergent. A series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n\) is convergent if \(\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n\) exists and is finite. A series where the limit doesn‚Äôt exist (because it goes off to infinity, or oscillates forever) is considered divergent. For example, the series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n}{2^n}\) converges to 2, while \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\) and \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n\) are divergent. Normally, in the study of infinite series, divergent series are simply marked off as divergent without any further investigation. However, there exist meaningful ways of assigning values to divergent series, which we will discuss here.</p>

<p>Throughout this page, we‚Äôll use the word <em>evaluating</em> divergent series in reference to any method that assigns a value to a divergent series. Notably, we reserve the word <em>summing</em> of a series to refer only to convergent series.</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-conventional-evaluation-methods">Problems with Conventional Evaluation Methods</h3>

<p>So, what happens if we try to ‚Äúevaluate‚Äù a divergent series normally? Take the following series: \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n.\) Let‚Äôs write it out:</p>

<p>\[1-1+1-1+1-1+\cdots = (1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+(1-1)+\cdots = 0\]</p>

<p>Now, if we pair up the terms a different way, we get</p>

<p>\[1-1+1-1+1-1+\cdots = 1+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+(-1+1)+\cdots = 1 \]</p>

<p>This raises an obvious issue, as a series can‚Äôt be equal to 0 and 1 at the same time. It turns out that we can‚Äôt manipulate conditionally convergent series in this way, let alone divergent series. Thus, we establish some criteria for methods of evaluating divergent series. Not every method will meet all of these criteria, which may impose some constraints on when they can be used.</p>

<p><strong>Linearity</strong> If $\sum a_n = S$, then $\sum k a_n = kS$. Furthermore, if $\sum a_n = S$ and $\sum b_n = T$, then $\sum a_n + b_n = S + T$. \end{defn}
\begin{defn} \textbf{Regularity:} A method of evaluating divergent series is said to be \textbf{regular} or \textbf{consistent} if it sums every convergent series to its ordinary sum. \end{defn}
\begin{defn} \textbf{Stability:} If $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n = A$, then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = A - a_0 $. \end{defn}</p>
