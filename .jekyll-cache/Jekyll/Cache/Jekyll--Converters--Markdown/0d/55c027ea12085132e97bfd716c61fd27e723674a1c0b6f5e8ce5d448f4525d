I"⁄<p>A useful contest trick, particularly for the AMC.</p>

<p>Sometimes, problems will give some general category, and ask you to find a property that holds true for everything in that category. In such cases, one can simply assume a convenient case in order to ‚Äúfakesolve‚Äù the problem.</p>

<p>The best way of demonstrating this is with examples.</p>

<h3 id="2021-amc-12b-problem-16--amc-10b-problem-18">2021 AMC 12B Problem 16 / AMC 10B Problem 18:</h3>

<p>Let \(g(x)\) be a polynomial with leading coefficient \(1,\) whose three roots are the reciprocals of the three roots of \(f(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c,\) where \(1&lt;a&lt;b&lt;c.\) What is \(g(1)\) in terms of \(a,b,\) and \(c?\)</p>

<p>\[ \textbf{(A) }\frac{1+a+b+c}c \qquad \textbf{(B) }1+a+b+c \qquad \textbf{(C) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{c^2}\qquad \textbf{(D) }\frac{a+b+c}{c^2} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{a+b+c} \]</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>

<p>Because the problem doesn‚Äôt specify what the coefficients of the polynomial actually are, we can just plug in any arbitrary polynomial that satisfies the constraints. Let‚Äôs take \(f(x) = (x+5)^3 = x^3+15x^2+75x+125\). Then \(f(x)\) has a triple root of \(x = -5\). Then \(g(x)\) has a triple root of \(-\frac{1}{5}\). Because \(g(x)\) is monic, we have \(g(x) = \left(x+\frac{1}{5}\right)^3 = x^3 + \frac{3}{5} x^2 + \frac{3}{25} x + \frac{1}{125} = \frac{125x^3+75x^2+15x+1}{125}\). We can see that this is \(\frac{1+a+b+c}{c}\), which is answer choice \(\boxed{(A)}\).</p>
