<p>Itâ€™s a well known fact that olympiads get harder over time. The rate of difficulty inflation varies, but it always happens.</p>

<p>For example, see Problem 1 from the first International Math Olympiad in 1959.</p>

<p>Prove that this fraction is irreducible for every natural number \(n\): \[ \frac{21n+4}{14n+3} \]</p>

<p>If you know the Euclidean Algorithm, Despite IMO 1959/1 being a proof problem, itâ€™s much easier than a midrange AMC 12 question now, and the AMC 12 is an open exam that doesnâ€™t require you to be in the top 6 of your country to take it.</p>

<p>At least in math, the increase in difficulty happens slowly and gradually over time.</p>

<p>For a more egregious example, see the <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=600">following problem</a></p>

<p>So what might be the cause of this difficulty inflation?</p>
