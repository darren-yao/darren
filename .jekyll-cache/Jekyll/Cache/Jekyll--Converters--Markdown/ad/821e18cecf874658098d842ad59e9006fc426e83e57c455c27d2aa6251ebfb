I"Ÿ<p>A useful contest trick, particularly for the AMC.</p>

<p>Sometimes, problems will give some general category, and ask you to find a property that holds true for everything in that category. In such cases, one can simply assume a convenient case in order to ‚Äúfakesolve‚Äù the problem.</p>

<p>The best way of demonstrating this is with examples.</p>

<p>Let \(g(x)\) be a polynomial with leading coefficient \(1,\) whose three roots are the reciprocals of the three roots of \(f(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c,\) where \(1&lt;a&lt;b&lt;c.\) What is \(g(1)\) in terms of \(a,b,\) and \(c?\)</p>

<p>\[ \textbf{(A) }\frac{1+a+b+c}c \qquad \textbf{(B) }1+a+b+c \qquad \textbf{(C) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{c^2}\qquad \textbf{(D) }\frac{a+b+c}{c^2} \qquad \textbf{(E) }\frac{1+a+b+c}{a+b+c} \]</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>

<p>Because the problem doesn‚Äôt specify what the coefficients of the polynomial actually are, we can just plug in any arbitrary polynomial that satisfies the constraints. Let‚Äôs take \(f(x) = (x+5)^3 = x^3+15x^2+75x+125\). Then \(f(x)\) has a triple root of \(x = -5\). Then \(g(x)\) has a triple root of \(-\frac{1}{5}\). Because \(g(x)\) is monic, we have \(g(x) = \left(x+\frac{1}{5}\right)^3 = x^3 + \frac{3}{5} x^2 + \frac{3}{25} x + \frac{1}{125} = \frac{125x^3+75x^2+15x+1}{125}\). We can see that this is \(\frac{1+a+b+c}{c}\), which is answer choice \(\boxed{(A)}\).</p>

<p>Two right circular cones with vertices facing down as shown in the figure below contains the same amount of liquid. The radii of the tops of the liquid surfaces are $3$ cm and $6$ cm. Into each cone is dropped a spherical marble of radius $1$ cm, which sinks to the bottom and is completely submerged without spilling any liquid. What is the ratio of the rise of the liquid level in the narrow cone to the rise of the liquid level in the wide cone?</p>

<p>Note that the problem doesn‚Äôt say what the height of the cones are. We can assume that the heights are very large numbers</p>
