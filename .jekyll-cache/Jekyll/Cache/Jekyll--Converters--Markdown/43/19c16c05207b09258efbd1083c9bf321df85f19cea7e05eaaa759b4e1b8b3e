<p>It‚Äôs a well known fact that olympiads get harder over time. The rate of difficulty inflation varies, but it always happens.</p>

<p>For example, see Problem 1 from the first International Math Olympiad in 1959.</p>

<p>Prove that this fraction is irreducible for every natural number \(n\): \[ \frac{21n+4}{14n+3} \]</p>

<p>Despite IMO 1959/1 being a proof problem, it‚Äôs much easier than a midrange AMC 12 question now, and the AMC 12 is an open exam that doesn‚Äôt require you to be in the top 6 of your country to take it. So what might be the cause of this difficulty inflation?</p>
