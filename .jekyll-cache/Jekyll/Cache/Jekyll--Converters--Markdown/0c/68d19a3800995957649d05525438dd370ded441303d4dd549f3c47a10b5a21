I"Å<p>‚ÄúDivergent series are the invention of the devil, and it is a shame to base on them any demonstration whatsoever‚Äù -Niels Henrik Abel</p>

<p>When discussing infinite series, we usually tend to classify them as convergent or divergent. A series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n\) is convergent if \(\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=0}^{N} a_n\) exists and is finite. A series where the limit doesn‚Äôt exist (because it goes off to infinity, or oscillates forever) is considered divergent. For example, the series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n}{2^n}\) converges to 2, while \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\) and $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n$ are divergent. Normally, in the study of infinite series, divergent series are simply marked as divergent, without any further investigation. However, there exist meaningful ways of assigning values to divergent series, which we will discuss in this paper.</p>
