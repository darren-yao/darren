<p>Itâ€™s a well known fact that olympiads get harder over time. The rate of difficulty inflation varies, but it always happens.</p>

<p>For example, see <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1959_IMO_Problems/Problem_1">Problem 1</a> from the first International Math Olympiad in 1959.</p>

<p>Prove that this fraction is irreducible for every natural \[ \frac{21n+4}{14n+3} \] is irreducible for every natural</p>
