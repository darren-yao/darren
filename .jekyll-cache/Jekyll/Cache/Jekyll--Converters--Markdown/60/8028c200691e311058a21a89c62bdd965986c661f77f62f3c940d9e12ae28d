I"Ö	<p>Itâ€™s a well known fact that olympiads get harder over time. The rate of difficulty inflation varies, but it always happens.</p>

<p>For example, see Problem 1 from the first International Math Olympiad in 1959.</p>

<p>Prove that this fraction is irreducible for every natural number \(n\): \[ \frac{21n+4}{14n+3} \]</p>

<p>If you know the Euclidean algorithm, this problem takes about 30 seconds to solve. This is much easier than a midrange AMC 12 question now, and the AMC 12 is an open exam that doesnâ€™t require you to be in the top 6 of your country to take it.</p>

<p>At least in math, the increase in difficulty happens slowly and gradually over time.</p>

<p>For a more egregious example, we visit the realm of computer science. For reference, the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO)â€™s Platinum division is roughly the top 200 pre-college competitors and is analogous to the USAMO; USACO Silver, while invitational, is roughly comparable to the AMC 12 in terms of difficulty.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=600">following problem</a> appeared in a USACO Platinum contest in January 2016. The techniques used to solve this problem are two-dimensional prefix sums with a sliding window algorithm, and the intuition needed to come up with the solution isnâ€™t particularly difficult.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, look at <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=1063">this problem</a> from USACO Silver in December 2020. While the intuition isnâ€™t super difficult here either, the techniques used are similar: two-dimensional prefix sums with coordinate compression and a couple other observations.</p>

<p>You can probably tell that the contest has gotten much harder because two problems of roughly similar difficulties ended up in different divisions of the contest over a time span of five years.</p>

<p>So what might be the cause of this difficulty inflation?</p>

<h3 id="more-students--awareness">More students / awareness</h3>

<p>The first reason is that these contests are simply becoming much more well known, and more students are taking them. In December 2015, USACO reports that 3784 unique students logged into the contest. Five years later, in December 2020, this number rose above 10,000. Despite this increase in participants, the number of students in the Platinum division has remained relatively constant. Therefore, there are more students competing for the same number of spots. If the difficulty were to remain the same,</p>
