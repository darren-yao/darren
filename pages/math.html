I'm a student at the <a href="eulercircle.com">Euler Circle Mathematics Institute</a>. The classes I've taken are Cryptography, Infinite Series, Abstract Algebra, Proofs from the Book, Markov Chains, and Complex Analysis.

NanoMath is a student-run nonprofit organization I founded that organizes math contests and other events.
